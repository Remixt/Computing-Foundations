#Computing Foundations I
###Introduces students to both data structures and formalisms used in computer science, such as asymptotic behavior of algorithms. Data structures and the formalisms used to both describe and evaluate those data structures simultaneously. By the end of the two-semester sequence, of which this course is the first part, each student has a solid foundation in conceptual and formal models, efficiency and levels of abstraction as used in the field of computer science.

#Computing Foundations II
###Continuation of Computing Foundations I. Further introduces students to both data structures and formalisms used in computer science, such as asymptotic behavior of algorithms. Data structures and formalisms used to both describe and evaluate those data structures simultaneously. By the end of the two-semester sequence, each student has a solid foundation in conceptual and formal models, efficiency and levels of abstraction as used in the field of computer science.
